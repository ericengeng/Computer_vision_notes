I put this repository together to aggregate my notes from the Udemy coursse Modern Computer Visionâ„¢ PyTorch, Tensorflow2 Keras & OpenCV4.  None of this code is original, I just added it for myself to reference back to and to see some of the projects I've followed.  The code was all typed out by me, but it is directly from the course.
